          <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Kameron.</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to Become Growth, a resource for Developers who want to make
            the leap to become Growth Engineers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built Become Growth, after finding out that the knowledge of
            growth engineering is scattered between various growth hacking,
            product engineering, and ancient marketing textbooks.
          </p>
          <p>
            My aim with this site is to distill growth engineering into a simple
            linear course so that you can ace any Growth Engineering interview
            that comes your way (or even use the skills to start a startup).
          </p>

Growth Engineers don't follow your usual everyday agile format. Instead of pointed technical tickets you can think of a Growth sprint to contain only spikes or experiments.

## Why "Experiments"?

As a Growth Engineer it is our job to look at data/research and form a hypothesis as to what the problem might be. From that, we then formulate solutions to solve that problem. Then we implement the solution and test whether it impacted the metric or research we've been watching. If not we go back to looking at the data, form another hypothesis, and the cycle continues till we improve the metric.

## Build, Measure, And Learn

Experiments generally follow the Build–Measure–Learn loop:

1. **Idea** - Starts by coming up with a hypothesis based on customer research or data analysis. 

2. **MVP** - Build a Minimum Viable Product in order to validate that hypothesis.

3. **Test** - Put that MVP in front of customers and learn from their feedback/interactions.

4. **Learn** - Did it change the metrics in a positive way? If yes, continue iterating on that feature. If no, go back to step 1.w

A Growth Engineer who can take an assumption, build a feature, and test it with customers will be able to validate and solve problems faster than a Customer Interviewer at Big Corp.

Another benefit from this approach is that you're able to quickly disprove an idea and cut losses without investing weeks of manpower. Disproving a hypothesis is as important as validating one because it means you can spend more time focusing on the real problems.

## A Note On MVPs

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is often a term used to justify shipping a crappy product to customers. That is not the case. Your MVP should look and act as a finished product and contain the required features to validate your assumption.

Startups often use a landing page with an email form to validate their initial idea. I'm not a fan of this as it doesn't really give you much feedback. Instead I prefer to solve the market problem in the hackiest way possible, for example:

* Zappos founder Nick Swinmurn wanted to test the hypothesis that customers were ready and willing to buy shoes online. Instead of building a website and a large database of footwear, Swinmurn approached local shoe stores, took pictures of their inventory, posted the pictures online, bought the shoes from the stores at full price after he'd made a sale, and then shipped them directly to customers. 

* Airbnb started as a hacked together website to advertise the founder's house as available for the weekend. They got a whopping three paying guests to their house.

* Uber’s beta version (then referred to as ‘UberCab’) started as a simplified mobile interface only used by the founders and their friends. To gain access you had to email one of the founders.

* Dropbox didn't even build a product but instead filmed a short video which demoed their product’s first build, explained their core value proposition and demonstrated how easy it was for people to share files across their devices.

Get creative when testing a hypothesis, don't always resort to building things yourself. Is there a third-party tool you can use that solves 80% of the problem? Can you tweak an existing feature to solve the problem? Can you manually provide a service to your customers to solve the problem?

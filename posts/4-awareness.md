The volume of people you reach is important. Finding ways to get people to visit your website and become aware of your product/service is the first real step in the funnel.

## Paid Ads

Paid advertising is any kind of advertising that you have to pay for. Marketers pay the owner of the ad space in exchange for use of that space to promote their products.

### Search Engine Ads

Search engine advertising is one of the most common forms of running paid ads. You'll often see examples of paid advertisements as the first few results on your Google search.

In a startup you'll often have a marketer who will be in charge of setting up and running these paid advertisements. It'll be the Growth Engineer's task, potentially, to help match up the advertising cookies with any website form submissions in order to improve down funnel tracking.

### Social Media Ads

Social media advertising can happen in one of two ways:

1. You pay Facebook/Twitter/Snap etc to display your Advertisement using their targeting tools.
2. You pay an influencer of your specific target market to talk/post about your product.

Whichever direction your company decided to take, make sure you have specific landing pages, tracking pixels, and conversion goals setup to test each channel's effectiveness.

### Newsletter & Content Ads

Replacing newspaper and magazine advertisements, newsletters are a cheap and engaging way to reach your target customers. Normally ads will be in the form of a piece of engaging content, commonly referred to as a "sponsored article".

**Hot Tip:**

When I'm trying to find newsletters to sponsor, i'll simply use a Google search term, such as:

> e.g: "growth" site:substack.com

Which will return me all of the Substack newsletters that have written about growth.

## Social Media Marketing

Creating viral content for social media seems more like luck than it does a skill. However, if we were to take a minute to research, we'd find that there a few people at the top of these platforms that seem to produce viral content almost daily.

Creating content that resonates with your ideal audience is paramount. The same goes for which platform you decide to post your content onto. **In order to create content that get's shared you need to first understand what's already being shared.**

### For e.g: HackerNews (HN)

Say you're ideal target customer is tech nerds. HackerNews is a great place to acquire those leads and get feedback on your business. If you were to open up the "/new" page, you'll find that getting to that coveted first page is harder than it looks.

So how do we create content that'll get us to the first page?

You have to find what made other content get to the top of HN. Below is a link that shows the top posts of all time from HN:

[https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&sort=byPopularity](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story)

If you negate the news articles as they're deliberate points for discussion and instead focus on smaller posts such as:

> I Sell Onions on the Internet

> Show HN: This up votes itself

> Why Iâ€™m done with Chrome

> Watch a VC use my name to sell a con

They all centre around controversy. I used that same controversy technique to get to the top of HN and generate 30k hits, with my article:

> First, it was Craigslist, next it's Zapier

## What is AAARRR?

The AAARRR framework separates a company into six steps (Awareness, Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue). Customers have to flow through each of these steps and, by tracking metrics in each step, you'll find the gaps in your business.

## Awareness

The awareness stage is the first step of the funnel. At this stage you're focused on attracting your target audience to your website through:

* Blogging
* Search Engine Marketing
* Social Media Marketing
* Paid Ads
* Direct Mail / Cold Calls

## Acquisition

Acquisition is all about capturing leads and turning them into customers or users. A lead at this stage can go through many different micro-conversions. For example: they may sign up due to a free ebook offer you had on your website, then attend an online webinar, then talk with your sales team over Intercom, and then finally they become a customer.

## Activation

Activation is all about finding a way to improve a customer's first time experience with the product. It's not enough to simply get people into the product, you also have to engage them, or they'll leave or churn. In order to do this you'll need to focus on getting the user to realize the true value of your product as quickly as possible so that they keep coming back.

## Retention

Retention means people regularly come back to use your product. For an e-commerce business that means someone not only buys from you once but multiple times. For an app, that means that users keep coming back and using the app. For a SaaS, this means that users who are subscribed to your software keep using it and stay subscribed.

## Referral

The cheapest form of marketing is referral. Turning your very own customers into marketers is a sure-fire way to rapidly scale your business. In order to do referral marketing correctly you'll need a system in place to incentivize your users to share your product with their friends. For example, Dropbox offered free storage space in return for their users tweeting about Dropbox.

## Revenue

If all the stages above are functioning correctly then revenue should already be coming in consistently. However, it's important for a startup to figure out a solid monetization plan rather than just solely chasing new users.

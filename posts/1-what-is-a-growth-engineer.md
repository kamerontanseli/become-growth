Growth Engineers work on improving the product, marketing website, and internal functions in order to impact all stages of a self-serve business' funnel. In a sense, the Growth Engineer is acting as a technical founder, harnessing marketing, sales, engineering, and product knowledge in order to improve business metrics.

## Hackers vs Engineers

A Growth Hacker is someone who uses creative, low-cost strategies to help businesses acquire and retain customers. Where as a Growth Engineer is someone who uses data analysis to run experiments to improve all stages of the funnel.

Hackers will work at the top of the funnel and will either be in the growth team or as a singular entity inside a marketing team. Engineers will be a core part of the growth team working with SEO specialists, PMs, and marketers in order to run tests and experiments.

## Product Engineers vs Growth Engineers

Product Engineers work exclusively on finding and creating features in order to improve user retention/engagement. They work the same way a normal engineer would except with a greater focus on user engagement and making the product a success.

Growth Engineers work across all stages of the funnel. They work in experiments rather than story pointed sprints, in terms of product they'll create small features or tweaks and test impact instead of working on full features like a Product Engineer would.
